#Marky

A super simple markdown to HTML parser.
---

Marky was designed as a simple tool to convert markdown files into html documents to help with my personal blog. All you need to do is include Marky in your project and call `marky('some markdown here')`. Marky then spits out a string of HTML ( `'<p>some markdown here</p>'` in that simple case ) that you can then use on your site.

Marky was built to fit my personal needs so it 'currently' does not support tables to code blocks, I will hopefully add them later on!
